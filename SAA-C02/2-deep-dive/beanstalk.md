# Elastic Beanstalk

- Developers usually don't want to manage infrastructure, they want to deploy code (lol :)
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying applications on AWS
- It uses all the previous components: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc.
- These components can be configured and instantiated via configuration files
- Beanstalk is entirely free, we only pay for the underlying infrastructure
- Beanstalk is managed service, which means:
    - Instance configuration, OS  is handled by AWS
    - Deployment strategies are configurable but they are performed by Beanstalk
- The application code is the developer's responsibility (obviously)
- There are 3 architecture models for Beanstalk:
    - Single Instance deployments, recommended for development
    - LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production
    - ASG only: great for non wen applications
- Beanstalk has 3 components:
    - Application
    - Application version: each deployment gets a version
    - Environments
- We deploy application versions to environments and can promote application versions to the next environment
- We can rollback to previous versions of the application
- We have full control over the lifecycle of the application
- Beanstalk has support for many applications:
    - Go
    - Java SE
    - Java with Tomcat
    - .Net on Windows Server with IIS
    - Node.js
    - PHP
    - Python
    - Ruby
    - Packer
    - Single Container Docker
    - Multi-container Docker
    - Pre-configured Docker
- There is an option for custom platform if the stacks above are not what we are looking for

# AWS CloudTrail

- Provides governance, compliance and audit for an AWS account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default
- CloudTrail provides a history of events/API calls made within an AWS account from:
    - AWS Console
    - SDK
    - CLI
    - AWS services
- Logs from CloudTrail can be put into CloudWatch Logs
- If a resource is deleted in AWS, CloudTrail should contain trace of the operation
- CloudTrail records account activity and service events from most AWS services and logs the following records:
    - The identity of the API caller
    - The time of the API call
    - The source IP address of the API caller
    - The request parameters
    - The response elements returned by the AWS service
-Trails can be configured to log data events and management events:
    - **Data events**: These events provide insight into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as data plane operations
    - **Management events**: Management events provide insight into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control plane operations. Management events can also include non-API events that occur in the account

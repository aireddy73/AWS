# AWS ElastiCache

- ElastiCache is a managed cache offering which supports Redis and Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with high performance and low latency
- The role of a cache is to reduce load from a database by caching query results
- It also can help make an application stateless by storing the application state in memory
- Provides:
    - Write scaling using sharding
    - Read scaling using Read Replicas
    - Multi AZ with Failover Capability
- Since it is a managed solution, AWS takes care of OS maintenance, patching, optimization, setup, 
monitoring, failure recovery and backups

## ElastiCache Solution Architecture 

### DB Cache

- Application queries the ElastiCache first. If no data is available for the query (cache miss), the application gets the data from RDS and stores it into the cache
- Caching helps relieve the load from the database
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is stored in the cache

### User Session Store

- Uses logs into the application
- The application writes the session data to the cache
- The session data can be reused by other instance of he back-end

## Redis vs Memcached

| Redis                                                   | Memcached                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Multi AZ with auto-failover                             | Multi-node for partitioning data (sharding) |
| Read replicas to scale reads and have high availability | Non persistent                              |
| Data durability and AOF persistance                     | No backup and restore                       |
| Backup and restore features                             | Multi-threaded architecture                 |

## ElastiCache Security

- All caches in ElastiCache:
    - Support SSL in flight encryption
    - **Do not support IAM authentication**
    - IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis AUTH
    - We can set a password/token when we create a Redis cluster
    - This is an extra layer of security on top of the security groups
- Memcached
    - Supports SASL-based authentication

## Caching Patterns

- Lazy loading: all the reads are cached, data can become stale in cache
- Write Through: adds/updates of data are cached when written to the database
- Session Store: store temporary session data in cache using TTL features

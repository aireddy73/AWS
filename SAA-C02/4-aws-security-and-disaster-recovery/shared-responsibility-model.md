# AWS Shared Responsibility Model

- AWS responsibility - Security **of** the Cloud
    - Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities and networking) that runs all of the AWS services
    - Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS etc
- Customer responsibility - Security **in** the Cloud
    - For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS (including security patches), firewall and network configuration, IAM etc.

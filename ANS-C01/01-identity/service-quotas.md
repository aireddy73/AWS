# AWS Service Quotas

- Defines how much of a "thing" we can use inside of an AWS account
- Example:
    - Number of EC2 instances at a certain times per region
    - Number of IAM users per AWS accounts
- Services usually have a default per region quota
- Global services may have a per account quota instead per region
- Most services quotas can be increased as needed
- Some service quotes can not be changed, example: number of IAM users per account (5000)

- **Service Quotas**: 
    - From the console we can go to this page, where we can create dashboards for quotas we want to monitor
    - We can request quota changes from this service for certain services
    - Quote request template: we can predefine quota value request for new accounts in an AWS organization
    - We can create a CloudWatch alarm for quotas
- Legacy method to increase quotas: create a support ticket selecting service quota increase
- We can request service quota increase from the CLI as well.

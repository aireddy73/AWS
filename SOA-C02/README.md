## Credits

- These notes are based on the Ultimate [Ultimate AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/) course by Stephane Maarek. This course was revised for SOA-C02 exam after these notes were created, so I recommend purchasing it

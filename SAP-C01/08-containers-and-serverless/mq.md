# Amazon MQ

- SNS and SQS are AWS services using AWS APIs
- SNS provides topics which are one to many communication channels, SQS provides queues which are one to one communication channels
- Both SNS and SQS are public services, HA and AWS integrated
- Larger organization might already use on-premise messaging systems, which are not entirely compatible with SNS and SQS
- Amazon MQ is an open-source message broker, is a managed implementation of Apache ActiveMQ
- It supports the JMS API and protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire and STOMP
- It provides both queues and topics
- It uses message broker services which can be single instance (test, dev) and HA pair (Active/StandBy for production)
- Unlike SQS and SNS, Amazon MQ is not a public service, it runs in a VPC
- It does not have native integration with other AWS services in the same way as SNS/SQS
- Amazon MQ considerations:
    - By default we should chose SNS/SQS for newer implementation
    - We should use Amazon MQ if we migrate from an existing system with little to no application change
    - We should use Amazon MQ if we need APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, STOMP
    - Amazon MQ requires the appropriate private networking

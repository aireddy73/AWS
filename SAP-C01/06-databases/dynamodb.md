# DynamoDB

- NoSQL, wide column, DB-as-service product
- DynamoDB can handle key/value data or document data
- It requires no self-managed servers of infrastructure to be managed
- Supports a range of scaling options:
    - Manual/automatic provisioned performance IN/OUT
    - On-Demand mode
- DynamoDB is highly resilient across AZs and optionally globally
- DynamoDB is really fast, provides single-digit millisecond data retrieval
- Provides automatic backups, point-in-time recovery and encryption at rest
- Supports event-driven integration, provides actions when data is modified inside a table

## DynamoDB Tables

- A table in DynamoDB is a grouping of items with the same primary key
- Primary key can be a simple primary key (Partition Key - PK) or composite primary key (Partition Key + Sort Key - SK)
- In a table there are no limits to the number of items
- In case of composite keys, the combination of PK and SK should be unique
- Items can have, besides primary key, other data named attributes
- Every item can be different as long as it has the same primary key
- An item can be at max 400 KB
- DynamoDB can be configured with provisioned and on-demand capacity (capacity = speed)
- For on-demand capacity, we have to set:
    - Wite-Capacity Units (WCU): 1 WCU = 1KB per second
    - Read-Capacity Units (RCU): 1 RCU = 4KB per second

## DynamoDB Backups

- On-demand backups:
    - Full copy of the table is retained until the backup is removed
    - On-demand backups can be used restore data and config to same region or cross-region
    - We can retain or remove indexes
    - We can adjust encryption settings
- Point-in-time Recovery:
    - Not enabled by default, has to be enabled
    - It is a continuous record of changes
    - Allows replay to any point in the window (35 days recovery window)
    - From this 35 day window we can restore to another table with a 1 second granularity

## DynamoDB Operation, Consistency and Performance

- We can chose between to different capacity mode at table creation: on-demand and provisioned
- We may be able to switch between this capacity mode afterwards
- On-demand capacity mode: 
    - Designed for unknown, unpredictable load
    - Requires low administration
    - We don't have to explicitly set capacity settings, all handled by DynamoDB
    - We pay a price per million R or W unit
- Provisioned capacity mode:
    - We set the RCU/WCU per table
- Every operation consumes at least 1RCU/WCU
- 1 RCU is `1 * 4KB` read operation per second for strongly consistent reads, `2 * 4KB` read operations per second for eventual consistent reads
- 1 WCU is `1 * 1KB` write operation per second
- Every table has a RCU and WCU bust pool (300 seconds)
- DynamoDB operations:
    - **Query**:
        - When a query is performed we need to take a partition key
        - Query item can return 0 or more items, but we have to specify the partition key every time
        - We can specify specific attribute we would want to be returned, we will be charged for querying the whole item anyway
    - **Scan**:
        - Least efficient operation, but the most flexible
        - Scan moves through a table consuming the capacity of every item
        - Any attribute can be used and any filters can be applied, but scan will consume the capacity for every item scanned through
- DynamoDB can operate using two different consistency modes:
    - Eventually consistent
    - Strongly consistent
- DynamoDB replicates data cross AZs using storage nodes. Storage nodes have a leader node, which is elected from the existing nodes
- Writes are directed to leader node
- The leader nodes replicates data to other nodes, typically finishing within a few milliseconds

## WCU/RCU Calculation

- Example: we need to store 10 items per second, 2.5K average size per item
    - WCU required: 
        ```
        ROUND UP(ITEM SIZE / 1 KB) => 3
        MULT by average (30) => WCU required = 30
        ```
- Example: we need to retrieve 10 items per second, 2.5K average size per item
    - RCU required:
        ```
        ROUND UP (ITEM SIZE / 4 KB) => 1
        MULT by average read ops per second (10) => Strongly consistent reads = 10, Eventually consistent reads => 5
        ```

## DynamoDB Indexes

- Are way to improve efficiency of data retrieval from DynamoDB
- Indexes are alternative views on table data, allowing the query operation to work in ways that it couldn't otherwise
- Local Secondary Indexes allow to create a view using different sort key, Global Secondary Indexes allow to create create different partition and sort key

### Local Secondary Indexes (LSI)

- **Must be created with the base table!**
- We can have at max 5 LSIs per base table
- LSIs are alternative sort key, same partition key
- They share the same RCU and WCU with the main table
- Attributes which can be projected into LSIs: `ALL`, `KEYS_ONLY`, `INCLUDE` (we can specifically pick which attribute to be included)
- Indexes are sparse: only items which have a value in the index alternative sort key are added to the index

### Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)

- They can be created at any time
- It is a default limit of 20 GSIs per base table
- We cane define different partition and sort keys
- GSIs have their own RCU and WCU allocations
- Attributes projected into the index: `ALL`, `KEYS_ONLY`, `INCLUDE`
- GSIs are also sparce, only items which have values in the new PK and optional SK are added to the index
- GSIs are always eventually consistent, the data is replicated from the main table

### LSI and GSI Considerations

- We have to be careful with the projection, more capacity is consumed if we project unnecessary attributes
- If we don't project a specific attribute and require that when querying the index, it will fetch the data from the main table, the query becoming inefficient
- AWS recommends using GSIs as default, LSI only when strong consistency is required

## DynamoDB Streams and Triggers

- A stream is a time ordered list of item changes in a DynamoDB table
- A stream is a 24H rolling window
- Streams has to be enabled per table basis
- Streams record inserts, updates and deletes
- We can create different view types influencing what is in the stream
- Available view types:
    - `KEYS_ONLY`: the stream will only record the partition key and available sort keys for items which did change
    - `NEW_IMAGE`: stores the entire item with the new state after the change
    - `OLD_IMAGE`: stores the entire state of the item before the change
    - `NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGE`: stores the before/after states of the items in case of a change
- In some cases the new/old states recorded can be empty, example in case of a deletion the new state of an item is blank
- Streams are the foundation for database triggers
- An item change inside a table generate an event, which contains the data which changed
- An action is taken using that data in case of event
- We can use streams and Lambda in case of changes and events
- Streams and triggers are useful for data aggregation, messaging, notifications, etc.

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

- It is an in-memory cache directly integrated with DynamoDB
- DAX operates within a VPC, designed to be deployed in multiple AZs in a VPC
- DAX is a cluster service, nodes are placed in different AZs. There a primary nodes from which data is replicated into replica nodes
- DAX maintains 2 different caches:
    - Items cache: holds results of (`Batch`)`GetItem` calls
    - Query cache: holds the collection of items based on query/scan parameters
- DAX is accessed via an endpoint. This endpoint load balances across nodes
- Cache hits are returned in microseconds, cache misses in milliseconds
- When writing data to DynamoDB, DAX uses write-through caching, the data is written at the same time to the cache as it is written to the DB
- DAX is not suitable for applications requiring strongly consistent reads

## DynamoDB Global Tables

- Global tables provide multi-master cross-region replication
- Tables are created in multiple regions and added to the same global table (becoming replicate tables)
- DynamoDB utilizes last writer wins in conflict resolution
- We can read and write to any region, updates are replicated generally sub-second
- Strongly consistent reads are only supported in the same region as writes
- Global tables provide global HA and global DR/BC

## DynamoDB TTL

- TTL = Time-to-Live
- In order to use TTL we have to enable it on a table and select a specific attribute for the TTL
- The attribute should contain a number representing an epoch (number of seconds)
- A per-partition process periodically runs for checking the current time to the value in the TTL attribute
- Items where the TTL attribute is older than the current time are set to expired
- Another per-partition background process scans for expired items and removes them from tables and indexes, adding a delete event to the streams is enabled
- These processes run on the background without affecting the performance of the table and without any additional charge
- We can create a dedicated stream linked to the TTL processes, having 24h rolling window for deletes

## SSM Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager

### Secrets Manager

- Automatic rotation of secrets with AWS Lambda
- Direct integration with RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB
- KSM encryption is mandatory
- Can integrate with ClouDFormation
- In general a more expensive solution for storing secrets

### SSM Parameter Store

- Has simple API

- KMS encryption is optional
- Can integrate with CloudFormation
- We can pull a secret from Secrets Manager using the SSM Parameter Store API

# S3 Encryption for Objects

- There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
    - SSE-S3: encrypt S3 objects using keys handled and managed by AWS
    - SSE-KMS: use AWS KMS to manage encryption keys
    - SSE-C: use KMS custom keys to encrypt data
    - Client Side Encryption

## SSE-KMS

- Allows to do server side encryption in S3, keys are handled and managed by KMS
- KMS: user control + audit trail
- In order to SSE-KMS to work, we must set the following header: **x-amz=server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"**

## SSE-KMS Deep Dive

- Under the hood SSE-KMS uses *GenerateDataKey* and *Decrypt* KMS API calls
- These KMS API calls will show up in CloudTrails, useful for logging and audit
- In order to be able to perform SS3-KMS, we need:
    - A KMS key policy to authorize the user/role
    - An IAM policy to authorize access to KMS
- S3 calls to KMS for SSE-KMS will count against our KMS limits

## S3 Bucket Policies

### Force SSL

- We can create an S3 bucket policy with a DENY condition of **aws:SecurityTransport=false**
- Note: using an allow on the same condition would allow anonymous *GetObject* if SSL is used

## Force SSE-KMS Encryption

- Deny any incorrect encryption header: make sure it includes `aws:kms`
- Deny no encryption header to ensure objects are not uploaded un-encrypted

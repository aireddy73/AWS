# CLI: Command Line Interface

Add user credentials locally using this command:
- $ `aws configure`

If you are using multiple AWS accounts, you can add custom profiles with seperate credentials using this command:
- $ `aws configure --profile {my-other-aws-account}`
- if you you'd like to execute commands on a specific profile:
  - example: `aws s3 ls --profile {my-other-aws-account}`
- if you don't specify the aws profile, the commands will be executed to your **default** profile

#### AWS CLI on EC2
* IAM roles can be attached to EC2 instances
* IAM roles can come with a policy authorizing exactly what the EC2 instance should be able to do. This is the best practice.
* EC2 Instances can then use these profiles automatically without any additional configurations

#### CLI STS Decode Errors
- When you run API calls and they fail, you can get a long, encoded error message code 
- This error can be decoded using STS 
- run the command: `aws sts decode-authorization-message --encoded-message {encoded_message_code}`
- your IAM user must have the correct permissions to use this command by adding the `STS` service to your policy

# CICD: Continuous Integration and Deployment

## Why use CICD?

- Ideally, we would want to set up a CICD to help you automate multiple steps to automate builds, push code to a repository and then deploy to your updated code to AWS.
- This is a faster, efficient way that also helps minimize potential mistakes as opposed to running multiple manual steps
- Automate deployement to different stages (dev, staging, and production)
- May add manual approvals when needed
- To be a proper AWS developer, you'd need to learn CICD

## CICD Services in AWS

- AWS CodeCommit: storing our code (similar to Github)
- AWS CodePipeline: automating our pipeline from code to ElasticBeanstalk
- AWS CodeBuild: To build and test code
- AWS CodeDeploy: deploying code to EC2 fleets (not Beanstalk)

## Continuous Integration

- Developers push code to a repository (Github, Bitbucket, CodeCommit, etc)
- A testing or build server checks the code as soon as it's pushed to the repository (CodeBuild, Jenkins CI, etc)
- The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed or failed
- Benefits of CI:
    - Find bugs and fix it early on
    - Deliver fast as soon as the code is tested
    - Deploy frequently
    - Unblocked developers are happy

## Continuous Delivery
- Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed
- Ensures deployment happen often and quick
- Ability to shift away from "one release every 3 months" to "5 releases a day"
- Automated deployments

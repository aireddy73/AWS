# CodeBuild

- Fully managed build service
- Alternative to other build tools such as Jenkins
- Continuous scaling (no servers to manage or provision – no build queue)
- Pay for usage: the time it takes to complete the builds
- Leverages Docker under the hood for reproducible builds
- Possibility to extend capabilities leveraging our own base Docker images
- Secure: Integration with KMS for encryption of build artifacts, IAM for build permissions, and VPC for network security, CloudTrail for API calls logging

## Overview

- Source Code from GitHub / CodeCommit / CodePipeline / S3...
- Build instructions can be defined in code
    - buildspec.yml file
- Output logs to Amazon S3 & AWS CloudWatch Logs
- Metrics to monitor CodeBuild statistics
- Use CloudWatch Events to detect failed builds and trigger notifications - Use CloudWatch Alarms to notify if you need “thresholds” for failures
- CloudWatch Events / AWS Lambda as a Glue
- SNS notifications
- Ability to reproduce CodeBuild locally to troubleshoot in case of errors
- Pipelines can be defined within CodePipeline or CodeBuild itself
- Supported Environments
    - Java
    - Ruby
    - Python
    - Go
    - Node.js
    - Android
    - .NET Core
    - PHP
    - Docker: extend any environment we like

## How does CodeBuild work?

- Two ways to run CodeBuild
    - Source Code
        - buildspec.yml
    - By building a Docker image
        - AWS Managed or Custom
- A CodeBuild Container is created
- We can add an optional S3 Cache bucket
    - Cache while We do multiple builds 
        - dependencies
        - artifacts
- Output to an S3 bucket
- Save logs using CloudWatch or S3

## CodeBuild BuildSpec

- buildspec.yml file must be at the root of your code
- Define environment variables:
    - Plaintext variables
    - Secure secrets: use SSM Parameter store
- Phases (specify commands to run):
    - Install: install dependencies we may need for your build
    - Pre build: final commands to execute before build
    - Build: actual build commands
    - Post build: finishing touches (zip output for example)
- Artifacts: What to upload to S3 (encrypted with KMS)
- Cache: Files to cache (usually dependencies) to S3 for future build speedup

## CodeBuild Local Build

- In case of need of deep troubleshooting beyond logs...
- You can run CodeBuild locally on your desktop (after installing Docker) - For this, leverage the CodeBuild Agent

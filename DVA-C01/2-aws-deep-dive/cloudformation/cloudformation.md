# CloudFormation

- Currently, we have been doing a lot of manual work
- All this manual work will be very tough to reproduce:
    - In another region
    - In another AWS account
    - Within the same region if everything was deleted
- Wouldn't it be great, if all our infrastructure was... code?
- That code would be deployed and create / update / delete our
infrastructure

## What is CloudFormation?

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you want to:
    - I want a security group
    - I want two EC2 machines using this security group
    - I want two Elastic IPs for these EC2 machines
    - I want an S3 bucket
    - I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
    - Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

## Benefits of CloudFormation

- Infrastructure as code
    - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
    - The code can be version controlled for example using git
    - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
- Cost
    - Each resources within the stack is staged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
    - We can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
    - Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely
- Productivity
    - Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
    - Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
    - Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
- Separation of concern: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers. Ex:
    - PC stacks
    - Network stacks
    - App stacks
- Don't re-invent the wheel
    - Leverage existing templates on the web!
    - Leverage the documentation

## How CloudFormation works

- Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation
- To update a template, we can't edit previous ones. We have to re-upload a new version of the template to AWS
- Stacks are identified by a name
- Deleting a stack deletes every single artifact that was created by CloudFormation

## Deploying CloudFormation templates

- Manual way:
    - Editing templates in the CloudFormation Designer
    - Using the console to input parameters, etc
- Automated way:
    - Editing templates in a YAML file
    - Using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) to deploy the templates
    - Recommended way when you fully want to automate your flow

## CloudFormation Stacks and StackSets

- A stack is a collection of AWS resources that we can manage as a single unit
- All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template
- A stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a web server, a database, and networking rules
- If we no longer require that web application, we can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted
- CloudFormation StackSets allow us to roll out our application into multiple regions and accounts. It is commonly used together with AWS Organizations

## CloudFormation Building Blocks

- Templates components (one course section for each):
    1. Resources: your AWS resources declared in the template (MANDATORY)
    2. Parameters: the dynamic inputs for your template
    3. Mappings: the static variables for your template
    4. Outputs: References to what has been created
    5. Conditionals: List of conditions to perform resource creation
    6. Metadata
- Templates helpers:
    1. References
    2. Functions

## CloudFormation Resources

- Resources are the core of your CloudFormation template (MANDATORY)
- They represent the different AWS Components that will be created and configured
- Resources are declared and can reference each other
- AWS figures out creation, updates and deletes of resources for us
- There are over 224 types of resources (!)
- Resource types identifiers are of the form:
    - `AWS::aws-product-name::data-type-name`
- Resource documentation:
    - All the resources can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html
    - Example here (for an EC2 instance): http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html

### Analysis of CloudFormation Templates

- Relevant documentation can be found here:
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-eip.html
    
### FAQ for resources

- Can I create a dynamic amount of resources?
    - No, you can't. Everything in the CloudFormation template has to be declared. You can't perform code generation there
- Is every AWS Service supported?
    - Almost. Only a select few niches are not there yet
    - You can work around that using AWS Lambda Custom Resources

## CloudFormation Parameters

- Parameters are a way to provide inputs to your AWS CloudFormation template
- They're important to know about if:
    - You want to reuse your templates across the company
    - Some inputs can not be determined ahead of time
- Parameters are extremely powerful, controlled, and can prevent errors from happening in your templates thanks to types.
- AWS offers us pseudo parameters in any CloudFormation template.
- These can be used at any time and are enabled by default

### How to reference a parameter

- The `Fn::Ref` function can be leveraged to reference parameters
- Parameters can be used anywhere in a template.
- The shorthand for this in YAML is `!Ref`
- The function can also reference other elements within the template

## CloudFormation Mappings

- Mappings are fixed variables within your CloudFormation Template.
- They're very handy to differentiate between different environments (dev vs prod), regions (AWS regions), AMI types, etc
- All the values are hardcoded within the template
- We use `Fn::FindInMap` to return a named value from a specific key

## When would you use Mapping vs. Parameters?

- Mappings are great when you know in advance all the values that can be taken and that they can be deduced from variables such as
    - Region
    - Availability Zone
    - AWS Account
    - Environment (dev vs prod)
    - Etc...
- They allow safer control over the template.
- Use parameters when the values are really user specific

## CloudFormation Outputs

- The Outputs section declares optional outputs values that we can import into other stacks (if you export them first)!
- You can also view the outputs in the AWS Console or in using the AWS CLI
- They're very useful for example if you define a network CloudFormation, and output the variables such as VPC ID and your Subnet IDs
- It's the best way to perform some collaboration cross stack, as you let expert handle their own part of the stack
- You can't delete a CloudFormation Stack if its outputs are being referenced by another CloudFormation stack
- Outputs examples:
    - Creating a SSH Security Group as part of one template
    - Create an output that references that security group

## Cross Stack Reference

- We then create a second template that leverages that security group
    - Use the `Fn::ImportValue` function
- We can't delete the underlying stack until all the references are deleted too.

## CloudFormation Conditions

- Conditions are used to control the creation of resources or outputs based on a condition.
- Conditions can be whatever you want them to be, but common ones are:
    - Environment (dev / test / prod)
    - AWS Region
    - Any parameter value
- Each condition can reference another condition, parameter value or mapping

### Defining Conditions

- The logical ID is for you to choose. It's how you name condition
- The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
    - `Fn::And`
    - `Fn::Equals`
    - `Fn::If`
    - `Fn::Not`
    - `Fn::Or`
- Conditions can be applied to resources / outputs / etc

## CloudFormation Transforms

- Transforms can specify one or more macros that CloudFormation can use to process our template
- Macros are executed in the order they are specified
- CloudFormation supports some macros predefined by AWS

## CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions

- Refs
    - The `Fn::Ref` function can be leveraged to reference
        - Parameters => returns the value of the parameter
        - Resources => returns the physical ID of the underlying resource (ex: EC2 ID)
    - The shorthand for this in YAML is `!Ref`
- `Fn::GetAtt`
    - Attributes are attached to any resources you create
    - To know the attributes of your resources, the best place to look at is the documentation.
    - For example: the AZ of an EC2 machine
- `Fn::FindInMap`
    - We use `Fn::FindInMap `to return a named value from a specific key
    - `!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]`
- `Fn::ImportValue`
    - Import values that are exported in other templates
        - Use the `Fn::ImportValue` function
- `Fn::Join`
    - Join values with a delimiter
- `Fn::Sub`
    - `Fn::Sub`, or `!Sub` as a shorthand, is used to substitute variables from a text. It's a very handy function that will allow you to fully customize your templates.
    - For example, you can combine `Fn::Sub` with References or AWS Pseudo variables
    - String must contain ${VariableName} and will substitute them
- Condition Functions (`Fn::If`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::Equals`, etc...)
    - The logical ID is for you to choose. It's how you name condition
    - The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
        - `Fn::And`
        - `Fn::Equals`
        - `Fn::If`
        - `Fn::Not`
        - `Fn::Or`

## CloudFormation Rollbacks

- Stack Creation Fails
    - Default: everything rolls back (gets deleted).We can look at the log
    - Option to disable rollback and troubleshoot what happened
- Stack Update Fails:
    - The stack automatically rolls back to the previous known working state
    - Ability to see in the log what happened and error messages

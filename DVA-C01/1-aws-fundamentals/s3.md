# S3 Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) fun “buckets” (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name
    - Naming convention:
        - No uppercase
        - No underscore
        - 3-63 characters long
        - Not an IP
        - Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Objects
    - Objects (files) have a Key. The key is the FULL path:
        - <my_bucket>/my_file.txt
        - <my_bucket>/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
    _ There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
    _ Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/“)
    _ Object Values are the content of the body:
        - Max Size is 5TB
        - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
    _ Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
    _ Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
    _ Version ID (if versioning

## AWS S3 - Versioning

- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3
- It is best practice to version your buckets
    - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
    - Easy roll back to previous versions
- Any file that is not version prior to enabling versioning will have the version “null”

## S3 Encryption for Objects

- There are 4 methods of encrypt objects in S3
    - SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects
        - Encryption using keys handled & managed by AWS S3
        - Object is encrypted server side
        - AES-256 encryption type
        - Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption”:”AES256”
    - SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
        - KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
        - Object is encrypted server side
        - Maintain control of the rotation policy for the encryption keys
        - Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption”:”aws:kms”
    - SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
        - Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
        - HTTPS must be used
        - Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made
    - Client Side Encryption
        - Client library such as the amazon S3 Encryption Client
        - Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
        - Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
        - Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

## Encryption in transit (SSL)

- AWS S3 exposes:
    * HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
    * HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight
- You’re free to use the endpoint your ant, but HTTPS is recommended
- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
- Encryption in flight is also called SSL / TLS

## S3 Security

- User based
    - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- Resource based
    - Bucket policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    - Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain
    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common
- Networking
    - Support VPC endpoints (for instances in VPC without www internet)
- Logging and Audit:
    - S3 access logs can be stored in other S3 buckets
    - API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
- User Security:
- MFA (multi factor authentication) can be required in versioned buckets to delete objects
- Signed URLs: URLS that are valid only for a limited time (ex: premium video services for logged in users)

## S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
    - Resources: buckets and objects
    - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
    - Effect: Allow / Deny
    - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
    - Grant public access to the bucket
    - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static website sand have them accessible on the world wide web
- The website URL will be:
    - <bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amzonaws.com
    - OR
    - <bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
- If you get a 403 (forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!
- 

## S3 Cors

- If you request data from another S3 bucket, you need to enable CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing allows you to limit the number of websites that can request your files in S3 (and limit your costs)
- This is a popular exam question

## AWS S3 - Consistency Model

- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
    - As soon as an object is written, we can retrieve itex: (PUT 200 -> GET 200)
    - This is true, except if we did a GET before to see if the object existedex: (GET 404 -> PUT 200 -> GET 404) - eventually consistent
- Eventual Consistency for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects
    - If we read an object after updating, we might get the older versionex: (PUT 200 -> PUT 200 -> GET 200 (might be older version))
    - If we delete an object, we might still be able to retrieve it for a short timeex: (DELETE 200 -> GET 200)

## AWS S3 - Other

- S3 can send notifications on changes to
    - AWS SQS: queue service
    - AWS SNS: notification service
    - AWS Lambda: serverless service
- S3 has a cross region replication feature (managed)

## AWS S3 Performance

- Faster upload of large objects (>5GB), use multipart upload
    - Parallelizes PUTs for greater throughput
    - Maximize your network bandwidth
    - Decrease time to retry in case a part fails
- Use CloudFront to ache S3 objects around the world (improves reads)
- S3 Transfer Acceleration (uses edge locations) - just need to change the endpoint you write to, not the code
- If using SSE-KMS encryption, you may be limited to your AWS limits for KMS usage (~100s - 1000s downloads / uploads per second)

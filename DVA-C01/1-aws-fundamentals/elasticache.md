# ElastiCache

Overview:
The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases, ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached. Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency. They help reduce loads off of databases for read intensive workloads. They help make your application stateless. 
- Write scaling using shading. 
- Read scaling using Read Replicas
- Multi AZ with Failover Capability
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups

## Solution Architecture - DB Cache

- Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache
- Helps relieve load in RDS
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there
User Session Store
- User logs into any of the applications
- The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
- The user hits another instance of our application
- The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in

## Redis Overview

- Redis is an in-memory key-value store
- Super low latency (sub ms)
- Cache survive reboots by default (it’s called persistence)
- Great to host
    - User sessions
    - Leader boards (for gaming)
    - Distributed states
    - Relieve pressure on databases (such as RDS)
    - Pub / Sub capability for messaging 
- Multi AZ with Automatic failover for Disaster Recovery if you don’t want to lose your cache data
- Support for Read Replicas

## Memcached Overview

- Memcached is an in-memory object store
- Cache doesn’t survive reboots
- Use cases:
- Quick retrieval of objects from memory
- Cache often accessed objects
- Overall, Redis has largely grown in popularity and has better feature sets than memcached
- Most likely, you’d probably only want to use Redis for caching needs

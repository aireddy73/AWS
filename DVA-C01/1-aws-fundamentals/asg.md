# ASG: Auto Scaling Group

- In real-life, the load on your websites and applications can change. You can create and get rid of servers very quickly

- The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
    - Scale out (add EC2 Instances) to match an increased load
    - Scale in (remove EC2 Instances) to match a decreased load
    - Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
    - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer

- ASGs have the following attributes:
    - A launch configuration
        - AMI + Instance Type
        - EC2 User Data
        - EBS Volumes
        - Security Groups
        - SSH Key Pair
    - Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity
    - Network + Subnets Information
    - Load Balancer Information
    - Scaling Policies

## Auto Scaling Alarms

- It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
- An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU)
- Metrics are computed for the overall ASG instances
- Based on the alarm:
    - We can create a scale-out policies (increase the number of instances)
    - We can create a scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)

## Auto Scaling Rules

- It is now possible to define “better” auto scaling rules that are directly managed by EC2
    - Target Average CPU Usage
    - Number of requests on the ELB per instance
    - Average Network In
    - Average Network Out
- These rules are easier to set up and can make more sense

## Auto Scaling Custom Metric

- We can auto scale based on a custom metric (ex: number of connected users)
    1. Send custom metrics from an application on EC2 to CloudWatch (PutMetric API)
    2. Create a CloudWatch alarm to react to low / high values
    3. Use the CloudWatch Alarm as the scaling policy for ASG

## ASG Summary

- Scaling policies can be on CPU, Network… and can even be on custom metrics or based on a schedule (if you know your visitors patterns)
- ASGs use Launch configurations and you update an ASG by providing a new launch configuration
- IAM roles attached to an ASG will get assigned to EC2 instances
- ASG are free. You pay for the underlying resources being launched
- Having instances under an ASG means that if they get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will restart them. Extra safety
- ASG can terminate instances marked as unhealthy by an LB (and hence replace them)

# ELB: Elastic Load Balancers

- Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream

## Why use a load balancer?

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

## AN ELB (EC2 Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer

- AWS guarantees that it will be working
- AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
- AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end. It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services

## Types of load balancers on AWS

- Classic Load Balancer (v1 - older generation - 2009)
- Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation - 2016)
- Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation - 2017)
- You can setup internal or external ELBs

## Health Checks

- Health checks are crucial for load balancers
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
- The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
- If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

## Application Load Balancer (v2)

- Application load balancers (Layer 7) allow to do:
  - Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
  - Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)
  - Load balancing based on route in URL
  - Load balancing based on hostname in URL 
- Basically, they’re awesome for micro services & container-based application (example: Docker & Amazon ECS) 
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port 
- In comparison, we would need to create one Classic Load Balancer per application before.That was very expensive and inefficient!
- Good to Know
    - Stickiness can be enabled at the target group level
        - Same request goes to the same instance
        - Stickiness is directly generated by the ALB (NOT the application)
    - ALB supports HTTP/HTTPS & Web sockets protocols
    - The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
        - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
        - We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and protocol (X-Forwarded-Proto)

## Network Load Balancer (v2)

- Layer 4 allow you to do:
    - Forward TCP traffic to your instances
    - Handle millions of requests per second
    - Support for static IP or elastic IP
    - Less latency ~100ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
- Network Load Balancers are mostly used for extreme performance and should not be the default load balancer you choose
- Overall, the creation process is the same as the Application Load Balancer

## Load Balancers Good to Know

- Any Load Balancer (CLB, ALB, NLB) has a static host name. They do not resolve and use underlying IP
- LBs can scale but not instantaneously - contact AWS for a “warm up”
- NLB directly see the client IP
- 4xx errors are client induced errors
- 5xx errors are application induced errors
    - Load balancer Errors 503 means at capacity or no registered target
- If the LB can’t connect to your application, check your security
